# travis

A command line binary (and library) for accessing the Travis CI API, with
several nice features. Running `travis wait` at the command line will yield the
following step-by-step output:

```
$ travis wait
Waiting for latest build on master to complete
Build 366972330 running (3m49s elapsed)
Build on master succeeded!

Step                                         1.10.x  master

Tests on master took 3m52s. Quitting.
```

You don't need to configure anything besides your API token.

Failed builds will display in your terminal in red. The output from failed
builds will also print below the summary statistics.

## Usage

```
$ travis -h
The travis binary interacts with Travis CI.

Usage:

	travis command [arguments]

The commands are:

	enable              Enable builds for this repository.
	open                Open the latest branch build in a browser.
	sync                Sync repos for the account.
	version             Print the current version
	wait                Wait for tests to finish on a branch.

Use "travis help [command]" for more information about a command.
```

More commands (rebuild, download-artifacts) may be added in the future.

The corresponding library is available at
`github.com/kevinburke/travis/lib`. View the library documentation at
[godoc.org](https://godoc.org/github.com/kevinburke/travis/lib).

### Custom Host

If you need to set a custom domain for Travis-CI, put the new host in your git
config:

```
git config travis.host "api.travis-ci.com"
```

Be sure to use the API host (usually api.domain.com), not the web host.

## Installation

Find your target operating system (darwin, windows, linux) and desired bin
directory, and modify the command below as appropriate:

    curl --silent --location --output=/usr/local/bin/travis https://github.com/kevinburke/travis/releases/download/0.5/travis-linux-amd64 && chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/travis

The latest version is 0.5.
